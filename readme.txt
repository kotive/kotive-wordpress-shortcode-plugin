**What is Kotive?**

[Kotive](http://kotive.com) is a webapp that enables anybody to build, share & run workflows for your business or life. You know your business best. Now you can create your own workflows or business processes to fit your business like a glove.

**Why is this useful?**

Shortcodes are clean! You can already copy and paste JavaScript or iframe code to embed a Kotive workflow or form onto a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the "HTML" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Shortcodes will work either way.
