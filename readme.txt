`[kotive groupId="190" taskflowHash="1800e4ed80cb489381fff178f5dd4247" height="450"]`

== Installation ==

For manual installation: copy the folder "kotive_shortcode" into the /wp-content/plugins/ folder. Then go to the Plugins area of the Admin and activate. Otherwise, search for "Kotive Taskflow Shortcode" from the admin area of your WordPress site in Plugins > Add New.

**What is Kotive?**

[Kotive](http://kotive.com) is a webapp that enables anybody to build, share & run taskflows for your business or life. You know your business best. Now you can create your own workflows or taskflows to fit your business like a glove.

**Why is this useful?**

Shortcodes are clean! You can already copy and paste JavaScript or iframe code to embed a Kotive taskflow or form onto a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the "HTML" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Shortcodes will work either way.
